    <h2><a id="recipe2">Texas Caviar</a> </h2>

    <ul>       
        <li>2 quarts canned black-eyed peas, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup red onion, diced </li>
        <li>1/2 cup green bell pepper </li>
        <li>1 cup Vinegar and Oil diced Dressing (see Cookbook page 44)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic, minced (1 teaspoon is enough for some folks)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Vegetable Seasoning (see Cookbook page 39)</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>Mix all ingredients well and marinate 8 to 12 hours, stirring a few times 
    to coat all ingredients well. Makes 2 1/2 quarts.</p>

    <p>Cowpeas into caviar. Anything is possible in Texas. This simple dish proves 
    the perfection of canned black-eyed peas. The onion and bell pepper provide 
    a delicate crunch,the vinegar a slight tang. For picnics, diets, our Three 
    Salad Lunch Special or good luck on New Yearâ€™s Day, you really ought to get 
    enough practice on this one to make it easy and frequent.</p>

<h2><a id="recipe3">Babinka's Potato Salad</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>4 Large potatoes (to be diced after boiling)</li>
<li>4 hard-boiled eggs, diced</li>
<li>3 heaping Tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
<li>1 heaping Tablespoon mustard</li>
<li>About 1/2 or more of a large pickle, diced</li>
<li>About 1/2 cup or more, cooked peas</li>
<li>Lawrey's (or other) Season Salt, to taste</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Peel the potatoes, boil them for forty minutes or slightly more.  They 
should be barely firm enough to dice them (without mashing them).  Allow 
the potatoes to cool before trying to dice them.  When dicing, the chunks 
can be fairly coarse.</p>

<p>Dice the eggs and pickles.  These chunks should be smaller than the potato 
chunks, perhaps the size of large peas.</p>

<p>Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.  Adjust the mayo, mustard, and salt, 
to taste.</p>
